## Projects

### 1. US Municipal Trade Activity by State 2023
This Tableau dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of US municipal trade activity by state for the year 2023. The primary focus is to visualize the number of trades, identify states with the most significant annual changes in trade activity, and detect outliers in trading patterns.

Visualizations Used:
Maps: To provide a geographical representation of trade activities across different states.
Tree Map: To compare the number of trades among states in a hierarchical format.
Bar Chart: To illustrate the annual changes in the number of trades, highlighting the states with the highest increases or decreases.
Box and Whisker Plots: To identify and analyze outliers in trading activity across states.

### 2. Open Tickets Aging Dashboard
This Tableau dashboard focuses on the aging of open tickets, segmented by assignment group and ticket age group. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of the distribution of open tickets and identify bottlenecks or areas requiring attention.
Visualizations Used:

Filters: To allow users to interactively segment and analyze ticket data by assignment group and age group.
Bar Charts: To display the count of open tickets across different age groups and assignment groups.
Heat Maps: To highlight areas with high concentrations of aged tickets, indicating potential issues in ticket resolution processes.
### 3. A Story of a Continent on the Rise

This Tableau story combines three different dashboards to narrate the compelling tale of a continent experiencing significant growth and development. The story leverages data to highlight economic, social, and infrastructural advancements across various countries.

Line Charts: To track changes in key indicators over time.
Bar Charts: To compare different countries and regions within the continent.
Maps: To provide a geographical context for the developments and investments.
Interactive Filters: To allow users to explore specific areas of interest in detail.

These projects demonstrate the versatility and power of Tableau in transforming complex data into compelling visual narratives and actionable insights. Each dashboard and story aims to provide a clear, data-driven perspective on various aspects of trade, ticket management, and continental development.
